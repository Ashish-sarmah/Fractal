# Fractal Dimension Analysis of Human Faces
This repository contains code for analyzing the fractal dimensions of human faces, specifically focusing on the regions of the face such as eyes, nose, and lips. It includes a database of sample images of human faces provided in Database.zip, and the main code for fractal dimension calculation is implemented in fractal.ipynb.

# Features
Calculates fractal dimension of face, eyes, nose, and lip regions.
Stores the calculated fractal dimension values in Excel files.
Analyzes the variation of fractal dimensions with emotions.
Predicts which face better represents a particular emotion.

# Contents
Database.zip: Contains sample images of human faces.
fractal.ipynb: Main code for calculating fractal dimensions.
HAPPY.xlsx: Excel file to store the calculated fractal dimension values for faces corresponding to the emotion "HAPPY".
fractal_final.xlsx: Excel file to store the calculated fractal dimension values for eyes, nose, and lips.
fractal.pdf: Provides detailed understanding of the correlation of fractal dimensions with human faces.
Report.pdf: Detailed report on the correlation of fractal dimensions with human faces, including analysis of emotions.

# Usage
Extract Database.zip to access the sample images of human faces.
Open fractal.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any compatible platform.
Run the code cells to calculate the fractal dimensions of various facial regions.
Check HAPPY.xlsx for the stored fractal dimension values of faces corresponding to the "HAPPY" emotion, and fractal_final.xlsx for the stored values of eyes, nose, and lips.
Refer to fractal.pdf and Report.pdf for in-depth analysis and correlation insights.
